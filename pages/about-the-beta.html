                    <p>The Office of the Historian is working on a new version of 
                        <a href="https://history.state.gov">history.state.gov</a>. In order to gather feedback
                        before the website is officially released, we are previewing the new site here, at
                        <a href="https://history.state.gov/beta">history.state.gov/beta</a>. Please have a 
                        look around and send us your suggestions via email at 
                        <a href="mailto:history@state.gov">history@state.gov</a> or on Twitter at 
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/HistoryAtState">@HistoryAtState</a>.</p>
                    <p>Please forgive our warts during this period. Certain features are incomplete and known to 
                        contain bugs. The data here is not updated as regularly as the main site. So please visit the 
                        original version of the site for its content.</p>

                    <h2>Features Currently on Display</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mobile device-friendly “responsive” design: Adapts to the size of your device and
                            is readable on any screen size, from smart phone to tablet and desktop. (On a computer, 
                            try making your browser window smaller, or, on a mobile device, try changing your screen’s
                            orientation; notice how the elements of the page adapt to the new size.)
                        </li>
                        <li>More fluid reading experience: Quickly advance forward or backward in publications
                            like the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series.
                        </li>
                        <li>A more stable, better performing server code: We have rewritten the entire site from 
                            scratch with the goal of delivering results faster and sustaining increasing loads 
                            much better. Nearly all code and datasets can be accessed
                            on <a href="https://github.com/HistoryAtState">our HistoryAtState GitHub repository</a>.
                            (Fork our code, and send us your pull requests.)

                        <li>Security: Your connection to this page and the entire beta site is SSL-only. 
                            We will be migrating soon to HSTS to ensure the integrity of your connection to this 
                            website.</li>

                    <h2>Features Planned for Future Releases</h2>
                    <p>Besides these features, we are laying the foundation for new resources on the history
                        of U.S. foreign relations and the Department of State:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A unified biographical database of all persons identified in datasets such as the 
                            <em>Foreign Relations</em> series, Principal Officers and Chiefs of Mission, Travels 
                            of the President and Secretary of State, and Visits of Foreign Leaders.</li>
                        <li>Chronological sorting of search results from the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series.</li>
                        <li>A database of historical country names, for connecting resources about places whose
                            names have changed over time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thank you for your interest in this beta, and please return for updates.</p>
