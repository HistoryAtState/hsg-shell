                    <p>The Office of the Historian is working on a new version of 
                        <a href="https://history.state.gov">history.state.gov</a>. In order to gather feedback
                        before the website is officially released, we are sharing the new site in “beta”—or preview form—at
                        <a href="https://history.state.gov/beta">history.state.gov/beta</a>. Please have a 
                        look around and send us your suggestions via email at 
                        <a href="mailto:history@state.gov">history@state.gov</a> or on Twitter at 
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/HistoryAtState">@HistoryAtState</a>.</p>
                    <p>Please forgive our warts during this period. Certain features are incomplete and known to 
                        contain bugs. The data here is not updated as regularly as the main site. So please visit the 
                        original version of the site for its content.</p>

                    <h2>Features Currently on Display</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mobile device-friendly “responsive” design: Adapts to the size of your device and
                            is readable on any screen size, from smart phone to tablet and desktop. (On a computer, 
                            try making your browser window smaller, or, on a mobile device, try changing your screen’s
                            orientation; notice how the elements of the page adapt to the new size.) The new design
                            is aligned with <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/">U.S. Web Design 
                                Standards</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>More fluid reading experience: Quickly advance forward or backward in publications
                            such as the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series. To try this out, visit <a 
                                href="$app/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v17/d116">this document</a> and select the 
                            “previous” or “next” arrows to the left and right of the document.
                        </li>
                        <li>Security: Your connection to the beta site—and all of history.state.gov—is now encrypted. 
                            This setting, called HSTS, forces all connections to the site to use a secure, HTTPS 
                            connection, ensuring the integrity of the pages you visit and preventing others from
                            tracking which pages you visit or what terms you search for. For more on this standard
                            and its adoption by U.S. Government websites, see <a 
                                href="https://https.cio.gov/">https.cio.gov</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>A more stable, better performing server, with all code and data
                            available for all to download, developed in the open: We have rewritten
                            the entire site from scratch with the goal of delivering results faster
                            and sustaining increasing loads much better. All code and datasets on
                            this site can be accessed from <a
                                href="https://github.com/HistoryAtState">our HistoryAtState GitHub
                                repository</a> and that of the core web application, <a
                                href="https://github.com/eXistSolutions/hsg-shell"
                                >hsg-shell</a> and deployment. At that link you can follow our
                            progress, fork our code, file issues, send us your pull requests. The <a
                                href="https://github.com/joewiz/hsg-project">hsg-project</a>
                            repository contains all instructions to install a complete copy of the
                            site on your own computer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
                    <p>Before the new site replaces the old one, we will be addressing the following
                        known issues. (A fuller list of issues is on the GitHub project site, <a
                            href="https://github.com/eXistSolutions/hsg-shell/issues"
                        >hsg-shell</a>.) Until then, please use the button at the top of this page
                        to reach the current site for these features.</p>

                        <li>The site-wide search is limited to the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series.</li>
                        <li>Links to ebooks and PDFs of <em>Foreign Relations</em> volumes from each
                            volume’s landing page are not yet available. Ebooks can be accessed
                            from the main <a href="$app/historicaldocuments/ebooks">ebooks</a>

                        <li>The OPDS ebook catalog API and atom feeds are not yet implemented.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h2>Features Planned for Future Releases</h2>
                    <p>Besides these features, we are laying the foundation for new resources on the history
                        of U.S. foreign relations and the Department of State:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A unified biographical database of all persons identified in datasets such as the 
                            <em>Foreign Relations</em> series, Principal Officers and Chiefs of Mission, Travels 
                            of the President and Secretary of State, and Visits of Foreign Leaders.</li>
                        <li>A database of historical country names, for connecting resources about places whose
                            names have changed over time.</li>
                        <li>Chronological sorting of search results from the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thank you for your interest in this beta, and please return for updates.</p>
