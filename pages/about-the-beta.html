                    <h1>About the Beta</h1>
                    <p>The Office of the Historian is pleased to present a new version of our public website,
                        <a href="https://history.state.gov">history.state.gov</a>. In order to gather feedback and work out any remaining kinks, we are sharing the new site in “beta”—or preview form. Please have a
                        look around and send us your suggestions via email at
                        <a href="mailto:history@state.gov">history@state.gov</a> or on Twitter at
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/HistoryAtState">@HistoryAtState</a>.</p>
                    <h2>Features of the New Version</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>A mobile device-friendly “responsive” design:</strong> Adapts to the size of your device and
                            is readable on any screen size, from smart phone to desktop. (On a computer,
                            try making your browser window smaller, or, on a mobile device, try changing your screen’s
                            orientation; notice how the elements of the page adapt to the new size.) The new design
                            is aligned with <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/">U.S. Web Design
                                Standards</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>A fluid reading experience:</strong> Quickly advance forward or backward in publications
                            such as the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series. To try this out, visit <a href="$app/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v17/d116">this document</a> and select the
                            “previous” or “next” arrows to the left and right of the document window.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Improved security:</strong> Your connection to the beta site—and all of history.state.gov—is now encrypted.
                            This setting, called HSTS, forces all connections to the site to use a secure, HTTPS
                            connection, ensuring the integrity of the pages you visit and preventing others from
                            tracking which pages you visit or what terms you search for. For more on this standard
                            and its adoption by U.S. Government websites, see <a href="https://https.cio.gov/">https.cio.gov</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Improved stability and performance:</strong> We have rewritten
                            the entire site from scratch with the goal of delivering results faster
                            and sustaining heavier traffic. The new site is also running on multiple
                            servers in multiple data centers for improved performance under load.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Open data, open source code:</strong> All of the content and code on this site is

                            are available at <a href="https://github.com/HistoryAtState">HistoryAtState</a> on GitHub. The web application is available at the <a href="https://github.com/HistoryAtState/hsg-shell">hsg-shell</a> repository. Follow our

                    <p>Besides these features, we are laying the foundation for new resources on the history

                    <ul>
                        <li>A unified biographical database of all persons identified in datasets such as the
                            <em>Foreign Relations</em> series, Principal Officers and Chiefs of Mission, Travels
                            of the President and Secretary of State, and Visits of Foreign Leaders.</li>
                        <li>A database of historical country names, for connecting resources about places whose
                            names have changed over time.</li>
                        <li>Chronological sorting of search results from the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series.</li>
                    </ul>
