                <p>This section provides historical reference information on aspects of
                    the United Statesâ€™ relations with the countries of the world. The central component is a guide to
                    matters of diplomatic recognition and the establishment and maintenance of diplomatic relations between
                    the United States and states of the world, from 1776 to the present.</p>
                <p>This guide brings together information on these subjects from among
                    diverse and widely scattered documentary and archival sources. The most significant categories of
                    information provided for each individual country include: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the date and circumstances under which the United States recognized, or was recognized by, each
                        state;</li>
                    <li>the date and mode by which the United States established diplomatic relations with each state;</li>
                    <li>the date the United States established a physical diplomatic presence through a legation, embassy,
                        or other mission in each country; </li>
                    <li>and the dates and circumstances of any interruption or resumption of diplomatic relations. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Over time, additional details will be added for each country, such
                    as information on the United States consular presence.</p>
                <p>Finally, this section also provides historical information on some
                    territorial entities that the United States has not recognized or with which it does not have diplomatic
                    relations.</p>
