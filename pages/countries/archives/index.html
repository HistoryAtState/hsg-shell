                <h1>World Wide Diplomatic Archives Index</h1>
                <p>The Office of the Historian has for many years provided researchers a guide to
                    the accessibility of diplomatic archives around the world, but this is the first
                    time it has been made available on the website. This current list is based on
                    information received from American diplomatic posts abroad, as well as web
                    sources and communication with the archives themselves. The information provided
                    here is subject to change so researchers are advised to contact the government
                    or archive ahead of any planned visit. </p>
                <p>While access to the diplomatic records of many countries remains highly
                    restricted, the news is better than ever before with many new countries
                    establishing Freedom of Information Acts to foment better government
                    transparency. </p>
                <p>The divide between the developed world and the developing world also affects the
                    state of international archives. Problems of infrastructure inhibit the nature
                    of information dissemination. The amount of information available on the
                    internet varies from country to country and many National Archives and
                    Ministries of Foreign Affairs are still in the process of developing workable
                    websites.</p>
                <p>This site does not comment on the state of the records themselves. In addition to
                    the loss of records as a result of changes of government and civil war, the
                    climate has wreaked havoc upon some archives, particularly in tropical regions,
                    whose documents, despite the best efforts of archivists, have been compromised
                    by heat, humidity, flooding, and frequent power outages.</p>
                <p>In compiling this database, the Office of the Historian has tried to give
                    researchers a starting place for their inquiries. We have not included anecdotal
                    advice on how to approach any given archive. Countries that do not
                    systematically declassify their documents may require personal contacts to gain
                    access to records of interest. Additionally, compliance with laws that guide
                    freedom of information may vary.</p>
                <p>For the most part, diplomatic records are held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                    (or a similar department) or have been transferred to a National Archive. If
                    that is done systematically, it is usually apparent as to which records are
                    available for viewing. When transfer is not systematic, it is up to the
                    researcher to discover the location of the documents they wish to view as well
                    as to make contact with the relevant archivist.</p>
