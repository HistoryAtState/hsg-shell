                    <h1>Department History</h1>
                    <p>Since its creation in 1789, the Department of State has carried out a series
                        of reorganizations and has created new offices and bureaus to deal with new
                        diplomatic challenges.</p>
                    <p>This portion of our website contains <a
                            href="$app/departmenthistory/timeline">an Administrative Timeline of the
                            Department of State</a>, <a

                            Officers and Chiefs of Mission</a>, and a history of <a

                            of State</a>.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State has grown significantly over the years. The first
                        Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief
                        clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained
                        two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. </p>
                    <p>World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945) brought vastly increased
                        global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent
                        power. New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the
                        Soviet Union, included: <ul>
                            <li>the newly independent states,</li>
                            <li>the global economy,</li>
                            <li>terrorism, and</li>
                            <li>the security of the American overseas presence. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>To address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and
                        overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to: <ul>
                            <li>1,228 in 1900,</li>
                            <li>1,968 in 1940,</li>
                            <li>13,294 in 1960,</li>
                            <li>and 15,751 in the year 2000.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and
                        continues to grow.</p>
