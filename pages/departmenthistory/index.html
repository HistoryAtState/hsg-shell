                <h1>Department History</h1>
                <p>Since its creation in 1789, the Department of State has carried out a series 
                    of reorganizations and has created new offices and bureaus to deal with 
                    new diplomatic challenges.</p>
                <p>This portion of our website contains 
                    <a href="/departmenthistory/short-history">a short history of the 
                        department</a>, <a href="/departmenthistory/people/secretaries">biographies 
                            of the Secretaries of State</a>, a database of 
                    <a href="/departmenthistory/people/principals-chiefs">Principal Officers and Chiefs of Mission</a>, and a history of 
                    <a href="/departmenthistory/buildings">the buildings of the Department of State</a>.</p>
                <p>The Department of State has grown significantly over the years.  The first Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. </p>
                <p>World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) brought vastly increased global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent power.  New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the newly independent states,</li>
                        <li>the global economy,</li>
                        <li>terrorism, and</li>
                        <li>the security of the American overseas presence. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>To address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1,228 in 1900,</li>
                        <li>1,968 in 1940,</li>
                        <li>13,294 in 1960,</li>
                        <li>and 15,751 in the year 2000.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and continues to grow.</p>
