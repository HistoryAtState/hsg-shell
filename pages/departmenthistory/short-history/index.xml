                                <p>This publication, “A Short History of the Department of State,”
                                    has been retired. The text remains online for reference
                                    purposes, but it is no longer being maintained or expanded.</p>
                                <p>Why retire “A Short History”? In mid-2016 the Office of the
                                    Historian completed a review of its online offerings and
                                    concluded that extensive resources would be needed to revise and
                                    expand this publication to meet the Office’s standards for
                                    accuracy and comprehensiveness. At the same time, the events
                                    described in the “A Short History” essays are amply covered by
                                    numerous respected secondary sources. Rather than duplicate
                                    these efforts, the Office of the Historian has decided to focus
                                    its resources on areas where it is uniquely suited to make a
                                    contribution, such as coverage of <a
                                        href="$app/departmenthistory/timeline">the Department of
                                        State’s institutional history</a>. In keeping with the
                                    publication’s new status, it can now be found under “More
                                    Resources” in the site-wide menu.</p>
