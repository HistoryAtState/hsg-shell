                        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                        <p>In the 1950s, Diplomatic Couriers traveled tens of thousands of miles per
                            year, crossing borders both geographic and cultural. The United States
                            and the USSR, once allied at the end of World War II, had become
                            adversaries in what became known as the Cold War, as Soviet power crept
                            further west across Europe. Events like the 1948 Communist coup in
                            Czechoslovakia and the Soviet blockade of West Berlin in 1948–1949
                            caused U.S officials to grow increasingly wary of the possibility that
                            Western European leaders might deal with their security concerns by
                            negotiating with Stalin and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Truman administration looked to military alliances and humanitarian
                            assistance to bolster the security and prosperity of Western Europe and
                            cement Euro-Atlantic ties. The <a href="$app/milestones/1945-1952/nato"
                                >North Atlantic Treaty</a> signed in in 1949 brought the United
                            States, Canada, and much of Western Europe into a collective security
                            alliance.  The <a href="$app/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan"
                                >Marshall Plan</a>, proposed by Secretary of State George C.
                            Marshall, directed $12 billion toward the rebuilding of Western Europe,
                            regenerating industrialization and bringing extensive investment into
                            the region.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet refusal either to participate in the Marshall Plan or to allow
                            its satellite states in Eastern Europe to accept the economic assistance
                            helped to reinforce the growing division between the East and the West
                            in Europe. The U.S. Diplomatic Couriers felt this division acutely as
                            they carried diplomatic pouches from behind the Iron Curtain in Western
                            Germany to our missions in Budapest and Bucharest, and from Helsinki
                            into the Soviet Union to support the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The
                            couriers traveled in pairs to ensure their own safety and the security
                            of the diplomatic pouches.</p>
                        <p>In the mid-1950s, Diplomatic Couriers often used the route of the famed
                            Orient Express train to deliver classified messages and material to U.S.
                            missions behind the Iron Curtain. Though stationed in Frankfurt,
                            Germany, the couriers held an apartment in Vienna which they used as a
                            base for the “Vienna Detail,” a 3-day journey by train to Budapest and
                            Bucharest and back. On this journey, the U.S. couriers were not the only
                            diplomats on board. Because of the difficulty traveling behind the Iron
                            Curtain, couriers from across Europe shared the passenger and sleeping
                            cars and often spent their off-duty hours together.</p>
                        <p>In this short documentary, the U.S. Diplomatic Couriers talk about the
                            journey and their personal impressions of what it was like to travel
                            further behind the Iron Curtain during this era.</p>
                        <p>Note: The original Orient Express was a train route from Paris to Vienna
                            established in the late 1880s by <i>Compagnie Internationale de
                                Wagon-Lits</i>, an international hotel and travel logistics company.
                            The route was later extended across the continent from London to
                            Istanbul, and several connecting routes were added including the Simplon
                            Orient Express, which reached into Italy, and the Arlberg Orient
                            Express, which ran from Switzerland to Greece.</p>
                        <p>During the early years of the Cold War, service continued behind the Iron
                            Curtain; however, the trains that traveled these routes were not the
                            famed luxury <i>Wagon-Lits</i>. Instead, both the trains’ rolling stock
                            and on-board service were provided by national railways.</p>

                        <h2>Transcript</h2>
                        <p><b>NARRATOR:</b> In 1918, the Diplomatic Courier Service was established
                            to support the work of American diplomats by ensuring that classified
                            messages and materials were delivered safely and securely to U.S.
                            embassies and consulates around the world. Over the 100 year history of
                            the Courier Service, this mission, critical to the national security of
                            the United States, has not changed.</p>
                        <p>In the 1950s, before the onset of the Jet Age, this small group of
                            couriers traveled tens of thousands of miles per year, often spending
                            months on the road. Following World War II, as tensions between former
                            allies grew into the Cold War and the Soviets consolidated power on
                            their Western border, it became increasingly difficult to reach our
                            posts behind what became known as the Iron Curtain. Because of a
                            continued mutual respect for international conventions on diplomatic
                            relations, even during these complicated times, diplomatic couriers were
                            among the few still able to travel across these borders. Each week, they
                            took the Orient Express from Vienna to reach Budapest and Bucharest.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. JAMES VERREOS:</b> Oh, the Orient Express. That was, of course, a
                            fabled train ride. We never got to ride it all the way to Constantinople
                            or Istanbul, but we would pick it up in Vienna and ride it in from
                            Vienna to Budapest to Bucharest. Then we would turn around and come back
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes inside Europe, we’d take train travel because it was more
                            effective and quicker than trying to take an airplane, especially when
                            we were providing service to the Iron Curtain countries, which required
                            two couriers to be on a trip for security reasons. We were carrying
                            classified material.</p>
                        <p>Top secret wasn’t always something that was written. In those days before
                            the technology we have today, we had to have code machines, equipment
                            that was highly classified.</p>
                        <p>Outside of the Iron Curtain you traveled solo. For example, when
                            delivering the pouches to Southeast Asia or Africa or South America, the
                            courier went out on trips solo. However, trips to the Iron Curtain, we
                            were always in pairs so that there was no possibility that the couriers
                            would be unable to have control of their pouches.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. KENNETH COOPER:</b> I think I’ve got the history right. The reason
                            we’d make paired trips behind the Curtain goes back to immediate
                            post-war. An American courier fell off the train, and he was killed, and
                            his pouch disappeared for a while. And there was some, I think, a little
                            suspicion that this was not an accident. Henceforth, the Americans
                            decided it would be a paired trip, and I think the British did the
                            same.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. DONOVAN KLINE:</b> You have to have somebody with the pouches at
                            all times. We’d get out and walk up and down the aisle in the
                            Wagon-Lits, but that was as far as we ventured. On the same sleeping
                            cars, there were other couriers from other nations—Italian, French,
                            Russians. When they were outside of Russia, they traveled paired, just
                            like we did behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                        <p>That’s one of the things about the Russians. They wanted the same
                            treatment in the West that we were given behind the Iron Curtain, which
                            was decent for the most part.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. PHILIP OLIVARES:</b> Well, your job was to take care of those
                            pouches. I don’t think we ever felt that somebody was threatening or was
                            going to try to steal them, but we always have to assume that.</p>
                        <p>In fact, I remember Jim Vandivier and I got off the train with our
                            pouches. There was quite a load. We pulled over one of these baggage
                            cars that was already half loaded, the porters said, and there were
                            Russian pouches on that. There were two Russian couriers. So here were
                            the four of us. He’s got the pouches, watching our own bags. There was
                            only one baggage car. We tried to get a separate one, but they said no,
                            and that was it. I thought how ironic—the four of us in this
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>We were stationed in Vienna. There were two of us then. Monday we would
                            go into Budapest and spend the night, and then the next day on to
                            Bucharest.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. COOPER:</b> Vienna itself was a lot of fun, and so was Budapest.
                            Except for the brief hiatus in Bucharest, which was dull as dishwater,
                            the rest of it was fun.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. ERNEST HOHMAN:</b> We used the Arlberg Orient Express, which came
                            out of Paris but we picked it up in Vienna. It’s just a delightful city.
                            It showed the grandeur that it had as part of the Austro-Hungarian
                            empire, even though it was somewhat damaged from the rubble after the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC - JOHANN STRAUSS - “THE BLUE DANUBE”]</p>
                        <p>The Austrians—one of the first things they thought was important to
                            rebuild was the Opera House. And now to see the change, the
                            transformation, the rebuilding that was going on there. Loved going to
                            the opera.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the Danube is not blue. It’s only in the eyes of a poet and a
                            composer.</p>
                        <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                        <p>[VOCALIZING]</p>
                        <p><b>MR. KLINE:</b> I attended my first and only opera, sung in German,
                            which I did not understand, and as a result never went to another opera
                            in my life. [LAUGHS]</p>
                        <p>We did a lot of eating and a lot of sightseeing. All of us did, because
                            it was a fantastic city.</p>
                        <p>I repeated that Vienna detail several times thereafter in later years. It
                            was always enjoyable for me because we got out of the air for a while.
                            It was restful. On those trains, all we did was sleep, eat, and play
                            chess or pinochle or something like that.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. VINCENT CELLA:</b> The courier would come down from Frankfurt
                            every week or twice a week to give us the stuff to take in. Then we’d go
                            shopping to get our food to take on the train, made sure we had enough
                            wine or scotch and reading material, cards, et cetera. And we’d leave at
                            night from the West Bahnhof in Vienna and made one stop, I guess it’s
                            called the North Bahnhof. And then into the border, which on the
                            Austrian side is Nickelsdorf. And it would stay there for some long
                            time. So, even though Vienna is not that far from Budapest, it was an
                            overnight trip.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. VERREOS:</b> The train, the Orient Express, would set up a single
                            sleeper car for the diplomatic couriers. That would be the British,
                            Queen’s Messenger, King’s Messenger, the Italians, whoever—any courier
                            from any nation that was making a trip would be on that train.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. HOHMAN:</b> The other people in the sleeping compartments, they
                            were all diplomatic couriers from various countries. There were Italians
                            and the British and the French also, because the air travel was not
                            possible, particularly during the winter months there.</p>
                        <p>We usually dressed rather casually at that point. And the Italians would
                            dress in their silk pajamas or a silk robe and so on.</p>
                        <p>The English, which were the Queen’s Messengers, they were great
                            storytellers, raconteurs, and had fantastic tales to tell.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. COOPER:</b> The Queen’s Messenger was usually a very senior
                            officer, an army officer or a military officer or sometimes civil
                            servant. They traveled in pairs also, but their junior courier was
                            usually a retired policeman, so there was a very distinct difference in
                            rank. So when the Queen’s Messenger had his dinner, the number two
                            courier would lay out a white tablecloth in this compartment and proceed
                            to serve him his meal. We got a kick out of that.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. OLIVARES:</b> The primary car for us was the old Wagon-Lits Cook.
                            They handled all the sleeping cars. The first class car was practically
                            all couriers. There was a dining car next to it, but the food was awful.
                            We had to cook our own food, so we all carried a little alcohol stove
                            we’d set up in a sleeping compartment and we’d cook on that.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. VERREOS:</b> The ride in would leave early in the evening, and we
                            would have dinner while we were on the train. We had developed an
                            international society of couriers, and we’d set it up in advance so that
                            the couriers from this country would bring in an entree, the couriers of
                            the other country would bring in the salad, who would bring in the
                            dessert, who would bring in the wine, and what have you. And we would
                            just merely leave notes so that next week’s couriers—we didn’t know who
                            they’d be, but you’d get into Vienna and say, hey, it’s this week, I
                            would say, well, if Ken and I were on a trip, we got the note at the
                            embassy we were supposed to provide the wine. We knew there’d be x
                            number of couriers on board, and we’d bring that much on.</p>
                        <p>Coming out was totally different. The train left Bucharest near midnight,
                            so everybody was sacked in, and it was dawn by the time you arrived in
                            Vienna.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. CELLA:</b> We slept in one compartment on that portion of that
                            trip. Then it would cross into Hungary, and that town was called
                            Hegyeshalom. After they stopped there for a long time, we’d go into
                            Budapest, and we’d arrive there in the morning.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. KLINE:</b> We’d get off the train and have a full 24 hour period
                            in Budapest where we could shop, look around. And the parliament
                            building there was magnificent, especially from across the river where
                            you could see it so plainly.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. HOHMAN:</b> It was an interesting city. It was still showing war
                            damage. The bridge across the Danube River was destroyed. It was laying
                            there in the river itself. But, you see, it had a glamor to it yet, and
                            it was trying to restore that. And it was and exciting and interesting
                            city with a bit of the schmaltz that you had in Vienna, Austria too,
                            with evening dinners that were excellent and violin music to go with
                            it.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. COOPER:</b> We’d have a layover sometimes, a day or so in
                            Budapest, which was fun. It was still a lively city, and it was before
                            the revolution.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. OLIVARES:</b> Budapest itself—I loved the city. A lot of people
                            consider it the Paris of Eastern Europe. It still had some damage,
                            though, from World War II, actually. And then after the revolution, of
                            course, it really got torn apart.</p>
                        <p>In spite of communism and all the restrictions they imposed on their
                            society, they were a really fun loving people. I remember going to a
                            nightclub and seeing the people dancing and having a ball, and I
                            thought, this can’t be. Everywhere else is usually so drab, like Moscow
                            itself. To see those people enjoying themselves and having fun, they
                            were a fun people.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. VERREOS:</b> Hungary was the nicest place in the Iron Curtain for
                            couriers. Even though you were always under surveillance by the local
                            KGB—they were called AVOs in Hungary—they were less intrusive than they
                            were in Moscow.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. CELLA:</b> We spent the whole day and the night at the Hotel Duna,
                            which was really a nice hotel right on the Danube. They had a nice
                            restaurant, a little nice bar, and there was a guy there that we used to
                            refer to as AVO Joe, and he would always befriend the couriers. And we
                            were sure that he were being paid by the AVO just to keep an eye on the
                            couriers, but we all sort of liked the guy. He was helpful, a funny old
                            guy.</p>
                        <p>And you enjoyed walking around Budapest, even though it was still pretty
                            well shot because of the revolution. In fact, they did more damage, I
                            think, during that time than they did during the war. What I always
                            understood was that the Russian troops didn’t want to fight against the
                            Hungarians, and the AVO were tougher on the Hungarian citizens than the
                            Russian soldiers.</p>
                        <p>The revolution started right in front of the Hotel Duna, and the two
                            couriers were stuck in there for about a week. They were Woody Vest and
                            Phil Olivares.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. OLIVARES:</b> We got off the station. We went to the Duna Hotel.
                            The Duna is the word for the Danube, of course. It was right on the
                            river. It was quite a hotel. It’s an old fashioned hotel with the high
                            ceilings and all that. We liked the place. And I remember Woody Vest and
                            I, we went to see the opera. They were doing “Eugene Onegin.”</p>
                        <p>We came back from the theater, and then we got into the elevator, and we
                            heard some noise and such about. We thought something’s going on around
                            town. I think we heard a shot or two, if I’m not mistaken. But I
                            remember—and in the elevator was the New York Times correspondent and
                            his wife.</p>
                        <p>And we said, well, we asked him, I said, “You know what’s going on?” He
                            said, “Oh, it seems to be a minor thing,” and all that. Well, [CHUCKLES]
                            we went up to our rooms. The next morning, we got a call from the
                            Legation saying “Stay put. You’re not going anyplace. Everything is
                            closing down. We’re in the beginning of an insurrection.” And that’s
                            when it started. And the shooting starts. And we just stayed put a
                            couple of days. There was British couriers in there as well.</p>
                        <p>There was some shooting. I think I walked out to see what was going on at
                            one point. I walked a few feet, and I heard bullets whizzing by my ear,
                            and I said, I better get back into the hotel. And then I realized it was
                            really bad. And they even brought in a Russian soldier who had been hit
                            by a sniper. One of the Hungarian insurgents was up on the roof.</p>
                        <p>[GUNFIRE]</p>
                        <p>The Legation wanted to evacuate most of the personnel. In fact, most of
                            legations—the British, as well. They put us in Embassy cars with
                            dependents, and we drove out of Budapest with the flag flying on the
                            fenders like Ambassadors’ cars. But I remember the people applauding and
                            clapping when they saw Americans and British flags. All around them were
                            Russians.</p>

                        <p>I remember, even in the hotel, the men behind the desk, the reception
                            desk, kept saying, “Where are you Americans? Why don’t you help us?”
                            They said, “Your Voice of America tells us to rise up, do something
                            about it, and now we need your help.”</p>

                        <p><b>MR. OLIVARES:</b> I felt so embarrassed by all of this, in a sense.
                            Why aren’t we helping these people? And I felt a little guilty that we
                            were like rats leaving this ship. There were applauding but we’re not
                            really doing anything for them. We should be doing something for them,
                            and we should have our tanks in here. But I know that’s not something

                        <p><b>MR. CELLA:</b> The longest part was when you got on the train the next
                            morning to Bucharest because that was overnight from the morning to the
                            next morning. After going all through the Ploiesti oil fields. Oh, you
                            see them burning the gas off the top. It was really something. Yeah,
                            that was pretty close to the end of the trip because they were up still
                            in the mountains. Not long after that, you came down into Bucharest.
                            You’d get in in the morning, and leave late at night. So you’d spend the
                            whole day in Bucharest.</p>
                        <p>For most of the time I was there, we stayed with the Military Attache, no
                            matter who he was.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. KLINE:</b> We would arrive in Bucharest early in the morning, six
                            o’clock or so, something like that, and we would go to the Military
                            Attache’s residence. He provided us with breakfast. They couldn’t get
                            fruits and vegetables and stuff like that. We would carry oranges into
                            them and give them oranges or bananas.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic colony there, the Western diplomatic colony, had a six
                            hole golf course at a club that they had where they had a bar. And you
                            could play six holes. And I did. I played six holes of golf there more
                            than once. A place for the Western community to relax without anybody
                            around spying on them. And I’m sure there was plenty of that behind the
                            Iron Curtain at all times.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know whether I was followed. I wasn’t looking for it. But we were
                            briefed beforehand: “Don’t fraternize. Don’t get caught with any women
                            behind the Iron Curtain, period.”</p>
                        <p><b>MR. CELLA:</b> Well, we went out a lot of times to that diplomatic
                            golf course, especially in the good weather. We would bring cigarettes
                            and razorblades and instant coffee to pay for our golf lessons. And
                            there was a little lake there where you could go out in a little boat to
                            help spend the day because it wasn’t that long and we left again that
                            night. We had to check in and get the pouches and leave to go back.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. COOPER:</b> I found Bucharest a very uninteresting city. Now they
                            were really behind the Curtain there. I can’t recall having any
                            interaction at all. For their sake and our sake, it was better not to.
                            That was my impression. Perhaps if I were to go back today, I’d be dead
                            wrong.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. HOHMAN:</b> Bucharest—yeah. We had time there too, and it’s a
                            poorer country. It was a dictatorship for quite a while under Ceausescu.
                            As we well know, the people were really dominated with the secret
                            police, although the communist elite led a very gracious and a very
                            luxurious lifestyle. I found it rather a poor city, by contrast even
                            with Budapest which still had a glory aspect to it.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. CELLA:</b> Going back it was a little different. We would get some
                            food in Bucharest, buy bread and buy this and buy that at these little
                            outlet stores. You know, you had to stand in line to buy some stuff. It
                            was depressing, in a way—for the people, I mean.</p>
                        <p>As we came back on that trip, we would leave in the night from Bucharest,
                            get in the next night into Budapest. The train would stop in Budapest
                            for quite a long time. You could see that red star in the foggy night
                            mist. Not until the next morning we’d end up back in Vienna.</p>
                        <p><b>MR. OLIVARES:</b> We’d enjoy those trips. I think we all did. I still
                            think it’s a more civilized way to travel, by train. Train stations were
                            fascinating in those days. They had all the excitement that airports
                            took on. I remember in Europe, the railway stations themselves—they were
                            big, cavernous affairs, mostly wrought iron and such. There was an aura
                            about them all that fascinated me. I felt so proud to be part of all of
                            that.</p>
