                    <h2 id="about">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This online resource continues a 1991 publication of the Office of the Historian,
                        <em>Principal Officers of the Department of State and United States Chiefs of
                        Mission</em>. Our intent is to document the history of U.S. representation abroad and
                    the chief policymakers in the Department of State. To that end, we have provided a
                    chronological listing of principal officers—essentially all Department officers at the level
                    of assistant secretary or above—and chiefs of mission. (See below for a discussion of the
                    term, “chief of mission.”) These two categories require Presidential or Secretarial
                    designation, and, in some cases, the approval of the Senate. We have made an attempt to
                    comprehensively list all people selected for these positions, even if they were not approved
                    by the Senate, died before taking office, declined the position, or were otherwise unable to
                    serve. For that reason, the pages which list our chiefs of mission by country are split into
                    two categories: “Chiefs of Mission” lists those who held the office, and “Other Nominees”
                    lists those who did not.</p>
                    <h3 id="positions-included">Positions Included</h3>
                    <p>This database includes officers of the Department who were presidential appointees (appointed
                    by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate) and chiefs of bureaus who hold
                    rank equivalent to Assistant Secretary of State. These include: Secretaries, Deputy
                    Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Deputy Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Counselors,
                    Legal Advisers, Chiefs of Protocol, and certain administrators.</p>
                    <p>Other positions have, from time to time, been included in the database based on their
                    particular circumstances. The complete lists of heads of the United States Information
                    Agency, for example, are included. USIA was incorporated into the Department in 1999. Other
                    chiefs of mission of particular historical interest have also been included.</p>
                    <h3 id="positions-excluded">Positions Excluded</h3>
                    <p>This database does <em>not</em> include representatives, personal representatives, or special
                    representatives of the President or Department of State; chargés d’affaires or chargés
                    d’affaires ad interim (except under certain circumstances); individuals holding diplomatic
                    commissions jointly with other representatives; special agents and other individuals on
                    special missions; high commissioners; chiefs of mission in charge of special economic or aid
                    missions; liaison officers; military governors or commanding officers of occupying forces or
                    their political advisers; delegates to international conferences; or consular officers who
                    held only consular commissions.</p>
                    <h3 id="what-is-a-chief-of-mission">What is a Chief of Mission?</h3>
                    <p>According to the Foreign Affairs Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-465, Section 102(3) (22 U.S.C.
                    3902)) a Chief of Mission is “The principal officer in charge of a diplomatic mission of the
                    United States or of a United States office abroad which is designated by the Secretary of
                    State as diplomatic in nature, including any individual assigned under section 502(c) to be
                    temporarily in charge of such a mission or office.”</p>
                    <p>The Chief of Mission is often – but not always – an Ambassador. There are currently three
                    classes of diplomatic representation established by the <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/17843.pdf">1961 Vienna Convention on
                        Diplomatic Relations, Article 14</a>: ambassador or nuncio (accredited to the Head of
                    State); envoy, minister, or internuncio (accredited to the Head of State); and chargé
                    d’affaires (accredited to the Minister of Foreign Affairs). These classes have a much longer
                    lineage. Although not a signatory, the United States followed Annex 17 to the Congress
                    Treaty of Vienna (March 19, 1815) which established rank and precedence of diplomatic agents
                    (ambassadors, envoys, and chargés d’affaires). The Proces-Verbal of the Conference of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle (November 9, 1818), recognized ministers resident as an intermediate class
                    between Ministers and chargés d’affaires.</p>
                    <p>The United States first used the rank of Ambassador in 1893, when <a href="$app/departmenthistory/people/bayard-thomas-francis">Thomas F. Bayard</a> was
                    appointed Ambassador to Great Britain on March 30 of that year.</p>
                    <p>A “chargé d’affaires ad interim” refers to a diplomat temporarily acting for an absent chief
                    of mission. This database tracks all chargé d’affaires and chargé d’affaires ad interim who
                    served (1) for a continuous period of 12 months or more, (2) at the establishment or ending
                    of diplomatic relations with a country, or (3) at the closure or opening of an embassy.</p>

                    <p>The type of information for each entry included varies based on the type of position. Entries
                    will have some or all of these pieces of information:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt id="name">Name</dt>
                        <dd>When possible, the full name of the appointee has been included.</dd>

                        <dd>The appointee’s state or territory of legal residence at the time of the appointment is
                        taken from the commission, nomination, or a contemporary official record of legal
                        residence. If the residence was omitted from these sources, the entry does not appear.
                        Some officers changed their legal residence during their careers; in such cases the
                        entry for their various appointments reflects the change in residence.</dd>
                        <dt id="career-status">Career status</dt>
                        <dd>Appointees are not categorized as “career” or “non-career” before the passage of the
                        Foreign Service Act of February 5, 1915, which restructured the Diplomatic and Consular
                        Services. For Chiefs of Mission holding office at that date, an asterisk by their names
                        in the alphabetical listing denotes those who were at the time of appointment (or who
                        had previously been for at least five years) Foreign Service officers, Foreign Service
                        information officers, or career officers in the Diplomatic or Consular Services. The
                        asterisk also indicates those few individuals who served as diplomatic secretaries, who
                        had then been commissioned before as Chiefs of Mission or as Presidential appointees in
                        the Department of State, who were not serving as Chiefs of Mission in February 1915, but
                        who were subsequently appointed or reappointed as such. All other appointees have no
                        asterisk, even though they may have been career officers in the civil or military
                        services. Career status reflects an individual’s status at the time of appointment. For
                        example, Richard Holbrooke served in the Foreign Service, but was not a career member of
                        the Foreign Service when appointed to his various positions, so he is listed as
                        “non-career.”</dd>
                        <dt id="dates-of-service">Dates of service</dt>
                        <dd>These dates are included on a position-by-position basis. Principal officers of the
                        Department who are presidential appointees have a date of appointment, date of entry on
                        duty, and date of termination of appointment. For those who were designated by the
                        Secretary, the date of appointment is the same as the date of entry on duty. For chargés
                        d’affaires ad interim, dates of service are listed from and to the nearest month.</dd>

                        <dd>The date of appointment is that which appears upon the face of the Presidential
                        commission issued to the appointee. It is frequently referred to as the date of
                        commissioning or the date of attestation. Recess appointments are valid only until the
                        end of the current session of the Senate. If the President wishes to keep a recess
                        appointee in office, the President must re-nominate the appointee.</dd>
                        <dt id="commission">Commission</dt>
                        <dd>A document attesting that the appointee has been appointed as a principal officer of the
                        Department or as a Chief of Mission. It is signed by the President and the Secretary of
                        State and bears the impression of the Great Seal of the United States. “Commission”
                        always connotes Presidential action.</dd>
                        <dt id="designation">Designation</dt>
                        <dd>This term covers chiefs of bureaus of the Department who are selected by the Secretary
                        of State. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states that “the Congress may by law
                        vest the appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President
                        alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” “Designation” always
                        connotes Secretarial action.</dd>
                        <dt id="nomination">Nomination</dt>
                        <dd>This is the date that the President sends to the Senate the name of a person whom he
                        wishes to appoint to a high-level position. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution
                        states that the President, “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall
                        appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court,
                        and all other Officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise
                        provided for, and which shall be established by Law.” Per <a href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270E%2C*P%5C%3F3%22P%20%20%0A">Senate Rule XXXI</a>, “Nominations that are not confirmed or rejected are returned
                        to the President at the end of a session or when the Senate adjourns or recesses for
                        more than 30 days.”</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h3 id="steps-in-appointment">Steps in Appointment</h3>
                    <p>Nomination is the first step in the appointment process. The President submits the name of
                    the person to be appointed to a high-level position to the Senate for approval by first the
                    Foreign Relations Committee and then by the full Senate. Approval by the full Senate is
                    called “Confirmation.” The appointee is then commissioned. After taking the oath of office,
                    he or she enters on duty. Ambassadors, however, are considered to have entered on duty when
                    they present their credentials to their host governments.</p>
