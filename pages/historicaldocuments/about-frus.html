                <h1>About the <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> Series</h1>
                <p>The <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> series presents the official documentary
                    historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic
                    activity. The series, which is produced by the State Department's Office of the Historian,
                    <a href="$app/historicaldocuments/frus-history">began in 1861</a> and now comprises more than 450 individual volumes. The volumes published over
                    the last two decades increasingly contain declassified records from all the foreign affairs
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <em>Foreign Relations</em> volumes contain documents from Presidential libraries, Departments of State
                    and Defense, National Security Council, Central Intelligence Agency, Agency for
                    International Development, and other foreign affairs agencies as well as the private papers
                    of individuals involved in formulating U.S. foreign policy. In general, the editors choose
                    documentation that illuminates policy formulation and major aspects and repercussions of its
                    execution. Volumes published over the past few years have expanded the scope of the series
                    in two important ways: first by including documents from a wider range of government
                    agencies, particularly those involved with intelligence activity and covert actions, and
                    second by including transcripts prepared from Presidential tape recordings.</p>
                <p>Volumes in the series since 1952 are organized chronologically according to Presidential
                    administrations, and geographically and topically within each subseries: 25 volumes cover
                    the <a href="$app/historicaldocuments/kennedy">Kennedy administration</a> (1961-1963), 34 cover
                    the <a href="$app/historicaldocuments/johnson">Johnson administration</a> (1964-1968), and about
                    54 are scheduled for the <a href="/historicaldocuments/nixon-ford">Nixon and Ford
                        administrations</a> (1969-1976). Volumes on the Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan
                    administrations are now being 
                    <a href="$app/historicaldocuments/status-of-the-series">researched, annotated, and prepared for
                        publication</a>.</p>
                <p>Volumes may be purchased through the <a href="http://bookstore.gpo.gov/subjects/sb-210.jsp">U.S. Government Printing Office</a> (202-512-1800). Recent volumes are also available
