                <h1>About the <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> Series</h1>
                <p>The <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> series presents the official
                    documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity. The series, which is produced by the Department
                    of State's Office of the Historian, <a
                        href="$app/historicaldocuments/frus-history">began in 1861</a> and now
                    comprises more than 450 individual volumes. The volumes published over the last
                    two decades increasingly contain declassified records from all the foreign
                    affairs agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <em>Foreign Relations</em> volumes contain documents from Presidential
                    libraries, Departments of State and Defense, National Security Council, Central
                    Intelligence Agency, Agency for International Development, and other foreign
                    affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in
                    formulating U.S. foreign policy. In general, the editors choose documentation
                    that illuminates policy formulation and major aspects and repercussions of its
                    execution. Volumes published during the last three decades have expanded the
                    scope of the series by including documents from a wider range of government
                    agencies, particularly those involved with intelligence activity and covert
                    actions.</p>
                <p>Volumes in the series since 1952 are organized chronologically according to
                    Presidential administrations, and geographically and topically within each
                    subseries: 65 volumes cover the <a href="$app/historicaldocuments/nixon-ford"
