                    <h2>Quarterly Releases</h2>
                    <p>From 2016 to 2018, the Office of the Historian released newly digitized
                        volumes in the <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> series on a
                        quarterly basis. This initiative was carried out in partnership with the
                        University of Wisconsin Digital Collections Center. The University
                        graciously provided the Office with high quality scanned images of the
                        series covering 1861–1960, and the Office then further digitized the text
                        from these images and enriched the text to create a full text searchable
                        edition.</p>
                    <p>With the print volumes now complete, the Office has begun digitizing
                        microfiche supplements from the series. Each volume undergoes two phases:
                        first, a "preview edition" is prepared, containing the front matter booklet
                        and PDFs of the documents; then, as resources allow, a full text edition is
                        prepared, replacing the preview edition.</p>
                    <h3>Recent Releases</h3>
                    <p>The most recent releases are summarized in the list below, with a link
