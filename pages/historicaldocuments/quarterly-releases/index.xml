                        <h2>Quarterly Releases</h2>
                        <p>From 2016 to 2018, the Office of the Historian released newly digitized
                            volumes in the <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> series on
                            a quarterly basis. This initiative was carried out in partnership with
                            the University of Wisconsin Digital Collections Center. The University
                            graciously provided the Office with high quality scanned images of the
                            series covering 1861–1960, and the Office then further digitized the
                            text from these images and enriched the text to create a full text
                            searchable edition.</p>
                        <p>With the print volumes now complete, the Office has begun digitizing
                            microfiche supplements from the series. Each volume undergoes two
                            phases: first, a "preview edition" is prepared, containing the front
                            matter booklet and PDFs of the documents; then, as resources allow, a
                            full text edition is prepared, replacing the preview edition.</p>
                        <h3>Recent Releases</h3>
