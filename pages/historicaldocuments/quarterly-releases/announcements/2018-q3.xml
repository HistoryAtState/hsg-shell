               <p>Today’s release is part of the Office of the Historian’s ongoing project, in
                    partnership with the University of Wisconsin Digital Collections Center, to
                    digitize the entire <em>Foreign Relations</em> series. The University graciously
                    provided high quality scanned images of each printed book, which the Office
                    further digitized to create a full text searchable edition. These volumes are
                    available online and as free ebooks at the Office of the Historian’s website (<a href="$app/historicaldocuments">https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments</a>). This is the latest in a
                    series of quarterly releases, which will continue until the <em>FRUS</em>
                    digital archive is complete.</p>
