                <h1>Pre-1861 U.S. foreign relations materials</h1>
                <p>The <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em>
                    <a href="$app/historicaldocuments/frus-history">began publication in 1861</a>. Prior to that time, the
                    U.S. government released documents through a variety of means.</p>
                <p>One of those means was the U.S. Congressional Serial Set, which began publication
                    in 1817. Your local library may hold the Serial Set or subscribe to an
                    electronic database which contains these documents. Two indexes of foreign
                    affairs-related documents in the Serial Set are available:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Between 1914 and 1921, Adelaide Rosalia Hasse compiled a three-volume <a href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/1100023.html">
