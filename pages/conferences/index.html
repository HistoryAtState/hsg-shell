                <h1>Conferences</h1>
                <p>The Office of the Historian periodically hosts or co-hosts scholarly conferences on specific
                    topics of interest related to the history of U.S. foreign relations. These conferences
                    typically aim to bring together former diplomats and policymakers with respected scholars of
                    U.S. foreign relations. The Office of the Historian has also been successful in including
                    current policymakers in these conferences. These conferences are generally open to the
                    public, although pre-registration might be required.</p><!--
