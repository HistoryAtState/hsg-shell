                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>The Office of the Historian is staffed by professional historians who are experts
                        in the history of U.S. foreign policy and the Department of State and possess
                        unparalleled research experience in classified and unclassified government
                        records. The Office’s historians work closely with other federal government
                        history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the
                        globe. The Office is directed by <a href="$app/about/the-historian">Dr. Stephen
                            Randolph</a>, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>The Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and
                        publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the
                        Foreign Relations of the United States series.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for
                        Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential
                        background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify
                        precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on
                        institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make
                        decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their
                        choices. The Office of the Historian conducts an array of initiatives, ranging
                        from briefing memos to multi-year research projects.</p>
                    <p>The Office of the Historian also promotes the declassification of documents to
                        ensure a complete and accurate understanding of the past.</p>
