                        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                        <p>The Office of the Historian is staffed by professional historians who are experts
                            in the history of U.S. foreign policy and the Department of State and possess
                            unparalleled research experience in classified and unclassified government
                            records. The Office’s historians work closely with other federal government
                            history offices, the academic historical community, and specialists across the
                            globe. The Office is directed by <a href="$app/about/the-historian">Dr. Stephen
                                Randolph</a>, The Historian of the U.S. Department of State.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>What We Do</h2>
                        <p>The Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the preparation and
                            publication of the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy in the
                            <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> series.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the Office prepares policy-supportive historical studies for
                            Department principals and other agencies. These studies provide essential
                            background information, evaluate how and why policies evolved, identify
                            precedents, and derive lessons learned. Department officers rely on
                            institutional memory, collective wisdom, and personal experience to make
                            decisions; rigorous historical analysis can sharpen, focus, and inform their
                            choices. The Office of the Historian conducts an array of initiatives, ranging
                            from briefing memos to multi-year research projects.</p>
                        <p>The Office of the Historian also promotes the declassification of documents to
                            ensure a complete and accurate understanding of the past.</p>
