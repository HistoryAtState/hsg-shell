                        has documented American foreign relations since its inception in 1861. The
                        Office of the Historian is further responsible for documenting the history of
                        the Department of State, for providing historical analysis and support to policy
                        makers throughout the Department of State, and for history-based outreach to the
                        educational community and the American public.</p>
                    <p>Prior to his arrival in the Department of State, Dr. Randolph served on the

                        Military Strategy and Logistics. He then served as the Associate Dean of Faculty
                        responsible for curriculum planning, accreditation, and strategic planning until
                        moving to the Department of State in 2011.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Randolph graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1974, and
