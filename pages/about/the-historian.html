                    the Department of State, for providing historical analysis and support to policy

                    responsible for curriculum planning, accreditation, and strategic planning until
                    moving to the Department of State in 2011.</p>
                <p>Dr. Randolph graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1974, and
