                            <p>The Office of the Historian is staffed by professional historians who
                                are experts in the history of U.S. foreign policy and the
                                institutional history of the Department of State. Our historians
                                possess unparalleled research experience in State Department and
                                other government records. The Office is directed by <a

                            <h2>What We Do</h2>
                            <p>The Office of the Historian is responsible, under law, for the
                                preparation and publication of the official documentary history of
                                U.S. foreign policy in the <em><a href="$app/historicaldocuments"
                                        >Foreign Relations of the United States</a></em> (FRUS)
                                series. The FRUS series presents the official documentary historical
                                record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions. The series began in
                                1861 and now comprises more than 550 individual publications. FRUS
                                publications contain historical documents from the Departments of
                                State and Defense, the White House, National Security Council,
                                Intelligence Community, and other agencies across the national
                                security establishment. Our historians compiling FRUS have full and
                                complete access to records in the Presidential libraries, the
                                National Archives, and Department and agency repositories.</p>
                            <p>The Office prepares historical and institutional studies for
                                Department principals that provide essential context, evaluate how
                                and why policies evolved, identify precedents, and derive lessons
                                learned.</p>
