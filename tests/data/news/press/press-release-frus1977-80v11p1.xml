         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Bureau of Public Affairs<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>November 17, 2020</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1977–1980, Volume XI, Part 1, Iran: Hostage Crisis, November
                    1979–September 1980.</p>
         <p>This volume is part of a <em>Foreign Relations</em> subseries that documents the
                    foreign policy decisions of the administration of President Jimmy Carter. The
                    volume documents the Carter administration’s efforts to resolve the U.S.-Iranian
                    crisis over the taking of U.S. hostages in Tehran. The absence of direct
                    diplomatic communications between the United States and Iran during this period
                    compelled the Carter administration to rely on a variety of official and
                    unofficial intermediaries in its attempts to negotiate the release of the
                    hostages. The administration considered and pursued a variety of diplomatic and
                    economic strategies intended to convince the Iranian Government that it should
                    take steps to end the crisis and secure the return of the hostages. Such moves
                    included negotiations regarding the former Shah of Iran and his presence in the
                    United States and other countries. The volume also documents Carter
                    administration officials’ consideration of military pressure strategies, while
                    they concurrently developed operational plans to rescue the hostages. Lack of
                    success in the negotiation efforts led President Carter to authorize a military
                    rescue mission in April 1980. The volume documents the rescue operation’s
                    failure to free the hostages, as well as the Carter team’s handling of the
                    mission aftermath and their continued work to achieve a resolution to the
                    hostage crisis. The volume concludes in early September 1980, when Iran seated a
                    new government and several leading Iranian officials publicly suggested their
                    readiness to end the hostage crisis.</p>
