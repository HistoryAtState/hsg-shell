         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Bureau of Public Affairs<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>May 31, 2018</strong>
         </p>
         <p>This revised edition incorporates critical material found since the publication
                    of the first edition in 2014. This added material consists largely of personal
                    handwritten notes taken at the September 5–17, 1978, Camp David summit by Samuel
                    W. Lewis, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel from 1978 until 1985. Department of
                    State historians found these notes while researching volumes for the
                    administration of President Ronald Reagan, amidst Department material dating
                    largely from the 1980s. Discovered subsequent to the initial publication of
                        <em>Foreign Relations</em>, 1977–1980, volume IX, Arab-Israeli Dispute,
                    August 1978–December 1980, these documents add significantly to the record of
                    U.S. diplomacy at Camp David. While they do not alter substantively the portrait
                    of U.S. diplomacy at the summit already represented in the first edition of the
                    volume, this material enhances the documentary record. Department of State
                    historians also located a more complete version of a document already published
                    in the first edition. Sometime shortly after the summit’s completion on
                    September 17, 1978, U.S. officials produced a draft day-by-day summary of the
                    meetings held over its duration. Readers familiar with the first edition will
                    note that the version of this summary document published in that edition covers
                    most, but not all, of the summit. As a result of these discoveries, the decision
                    was taken to issue a revised edition.</p>
         <p>This volume was compiled and edited by Alexander R. Wieland. The volume and this
                    press release are available on the Office of the Historian website at <a href="/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v09Ed2">https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v09Ed2</a>. Copies
