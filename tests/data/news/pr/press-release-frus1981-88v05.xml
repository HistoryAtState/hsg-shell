         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Foreign Service Institute<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>December 1, 2020</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1981–1988, Volume V, Soviet Union, March 1985–October 1986.</p>
         <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <em>Foreign Relations</em>
                    series that documents the foreign policy decisions of the administration of
                    President Ronald Reagan. The volume documents the development and implementation
                    of the Reagan administration’s policies toward the Soviet Union from March 1985
                    to October 1986. The volume focuses on how the administration approached the new
                    Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and his reform efforts; arms control
                    negotiations at the Nuclear and Space Talks, which opened in Geneva in March
                    1985; the Geneva Summit of November 1985 and the Reykjavik Summit of October
                    1986, and various meetings among President Reagan, Secretary of State George
                    Shultz, and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, his replacement Eduard
                    Shevardnadze, and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin.</p>
         <p>The documentation in this volume provides a more nuanced understanding of the
                    relationship that developed between Reagan and Gorbachev during this period,
                    through their summits and correspondence. The volume also shows how the Reagan
                    administration continued to adhere to the four-part framework it established in
                    January 1983 in dealing with the Soviet Union, regardless of the new leadership
                    of Gorbachev. Administration officials worked diligently to move the U.S.-Soviet
                    relationship forward; the sustained level of understanding and cooperation they
                    developed with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze played a major role in this
                    endeavor.</p>
