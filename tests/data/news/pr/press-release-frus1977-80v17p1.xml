         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Bureau of Public Affairs<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>November 18, 2016</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1977–1980, Volume XVII, Part 1, Horn of Africa.</p>
         <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <em>Foreign Relations</em>
                    series that documents the foreign policy decision making of the administration
                    of President Jimmy Carter. The focus of the volume is on the administration’s
                    approach to events in the Horn of Africa and includes relations with Ethiopia,
                    Somalia, and Djibouti (before and after its independence). </p>
         <p>This volume addresses Somali President Siad Barre’s entreaties for U.S. military
                    aid before and after the Somali invasion of Ethiopia’s Ogaden Desert, the U.S.
                    response to Soviet and Cuban intervention on behalf of Ethiopia, attempts to
                    negotiate an end to the Ogaden war, and efforts to retain U.S. influence in the
                    region. Furthermore, the volume documents the arguments between Secretary of
                    State Cyrus Vance and the Assistant to the President for National Security
                    Affairs Zbigniew Brzezinski over an appropriate response to the Soviet
                    intervention, and whether to link Soviet behavior in the Horn of Africa to other
                    bilateral issues, such as Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.</p>
         <p>This volume was compiled and edited by Louise P. Woodroofe. The volume and this
