         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Foreign Service Institute<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>April 22, 2021</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1981–1988, Volume XI, START I.</p>
         <p>This is the first of two volumes in the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series devoted
                    to the START I agreement (the “Treaty Between the United States of America and
                    the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics on the Reduction and Limitation of
                    Strategic Offensive Arms”), which President George H.W. Bush and Soviet leader
                    Mikhail Gorbachev signed on July 31, 1991. It begins in the summer of 1981, when
                    the Reagan administration recast the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) as
                    the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) and concludes in early 1989 with the
                    presidential transition to the Bush administration. Covered here are the initial
                    rounds of negotiations in Geneva from June 1982 to November 1983; the
                    incorporation of START into the Nuclear and Space Arms Talks (NST) in March
                    1985; the five meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev between 1985 and 1988; and
                    the internal U.S. deliberations on strategic arms negotiations throughout these
                    periods. Given the pivotal role of strategic defenses in negotiations on
                    strategic arms reductions, deliberations and instructions pertaining to the
                    Defense and Space Talks are also included in this volume. </p>
         <p>This volume was compiled and edited by James Graham Wilson. The volume and this
