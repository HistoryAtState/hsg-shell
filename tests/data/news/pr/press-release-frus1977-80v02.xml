         <p>The Department of State released today <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v02">

         <p>This volume is part of a <em>Foreign Relations</em> subseries that documents the
                    most important issues in the foreign policy of the administration of Jimmy
                    Carter. It illustrates the Carter administration’s efforts to define and
                    implement a broad-based human rights policy, including the establishment of the
                    Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs within the Department of State,
                    the creation of human rights coordinating and review groups, issuance of a
                    Presidential Directive on human rights, institutionalization and standardization
                    of human rights reporting, and pursuit of human rights within the United Nations
                    and other multilateral venues. The volume also documents steps undertaken by the
                    Carter administration to fight hunger, launch a global health initiative, and
                    advocate for women’s rights.</p>
