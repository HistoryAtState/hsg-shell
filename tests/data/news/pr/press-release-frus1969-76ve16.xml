         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Bureau of Public Affairs <br/> United States
                        Department of State<br/>November 6, 2015</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1969–1976, Volume E–16, Documents on Chile, 1969–1973. This
                    volume is part of a Foreign Relations subseries that documents the most
                    important foreign policy issues of the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford
                    presidential administrations. The volume documents U.S. policy toward Chile from
                    January 1969 to September 24, 1973, when the Nixon administration announced its
                    extension of diplomatic recognition to the military junta under General Augusto
                    Pinochet. It is an online-only supplement to <em>Foreign Relations</em>,
                    1969–1976, Volume XXI, Chile, 1969–1973, and should be read in conjunction with
                    that volume, as well with the upcoming <em>Foreign Relations</em>, 1969–1976,
                    Volume E–11, Part 2, Documents on South America, 1973–1976. </p>
         <p>The primary focus of Volume E–16 is on the attitudes adopted and actions taken by
                    the U.S. Government toward the installation of two successive Chilean
                    presidents: the election and inauguration of Salvador Allende in September 1970
                    and the military coup d’état of General Augusto Pinochet in September 1973. In
                    contrast to the printed volume, this supplement includes a selection of
                    Presidential tape recordings, as transcribed by the editors, which add context
                    and detail to formal records on President Nixon’s posture toward President
                    Allende, as well as several documents on human rights violations in the
                    aftermath of the Pinochet coup d’état. </p>
         <p>This volume was compiled and edited by James McElveen and James Siekmeier , and
                    is available exclusively on the Office of the Historian website at <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve16">http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve16</a>. For
