         <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Bureau of Public Affairs<br/>United States
                    Department of State</strong>
         <br/>
         <strong>December 20, 2018</strong>
         <p>The Department of State released today <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v12">
               <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em>, 1977–1980, Volume XII,
                        Afghanistan</a>.</p>
         <p>This volume is part of a <em>Foreign Relations</em> subseries that documents the
                    most important foreign policy issues of the Jimmy Carter administration. The
                    focus of this volume is on the Carter administration’s approach to events in
                    Afghanistan during the buildup of the Soviet Union’s presence in that country
                    beginning in early 1978 and culminating in the large scale invasion of Soviet
                    troops at the end of 1979. Officials in the Carter administration regarded
                    Soviet actions as among the most flagrant violations of international norms
                    during the Cold War. The volume is arranged chronologically, with the majority
                    of documents concentrated around the crisis period during the lead-up to the
                    invasion, and during the aftermath, when the Carter administration formulated a
                    range of policy responses to challenge the Soviet Union’s domination of
                    Afghanistan. </p>
         <p>This compilation was compiled and edited by David Zierler. This PDF version of
                    the volume and press release are available on the Office of the Historian
                    website at <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v12">https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v12</a>. The full
                    text and ebooks of the volume will be released on a later date. Copies of the
                    volume will be available for purchase from the U.S. Government Printing Office
