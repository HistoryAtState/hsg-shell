         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Foreign Service Institute<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>February 16, 2021</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1981–1988, Volume IV, Soviet Union, January 1983–March 1985</p>
         <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <em>Foreign Relations</em>
                    series that documents the foreign policy decisions of the administration of
                    President Ronald Reagan. The focus of the volume is on the development of the
                    Reagan administration’s policies toward the Soviet Union from January 1983 to
                    March 1985.</p>
         <p>The documentation demonstrates how administration officials developed a four-part
                    agenda to deal with the Soviet Union on arms control, human rights, regional
                    issues, and bilateral relations, and then promoted U.S. positions on these
                    various issues during meetings with Soviet officials. The volume documents
                    several Cold War flashpoints during the contentious months of 1983: the
                    announcement in March 1983 of Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), the
                    downing of the KAL 007 airliner by the Soviet Union on August 31, 1983, and the
                    deployments of INF missiles to several NATO allied countries in late November
                    1983, which led to the Soviet walkout of arms control negotiations in Geneva.
                    The volume also presents selective documentation related to the 1983 Soviet “War
                    Scare” and the November 1983 NATO nuclear exercise, Able Archer (see <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/#appxA">Appendix A</a>).
                    Even with these challenges, Secretary of State George Shultz and others pressed
                    to keep moving ahead with the four-part agenda and promote greater dialogue in
                    U.S.-Soviet relations. This culminated in an agreement to open new arms control
                    negotiations, the Nuclear and Space talks, on three tracks: START, INF, and
                    Defense and Space, starting in March 1985.</p>
