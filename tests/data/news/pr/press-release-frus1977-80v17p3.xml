         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Bureau of Public Affairs<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>October 31, 2017</strong>
         </p>
         <p>This volume is part of a <em>Foreign Relations</em> subseries that documents the
                    foreign policy decisions of the administration of President Jimmy Carter. The
                    volume documents the Carter administration’s efforts to promote peace and
                    stability in the Maghreb through a variety of strategies that addressed the many
                    challenges in the region: “normalizing” relations with Algeria and Libya;
                    reassuring Morocco and Tunisia of the administration’s continued support and
                    consultation on the Middle East peace initiative; and serving as an “honest
                    broker” in the regional dispute over the Western Sahara.</p>
         <p>This volume was compiled and edited by Myra F. Burton. The volume and this press
