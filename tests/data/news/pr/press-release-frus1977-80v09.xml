         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Bureau of Public Affairs<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>December 18, 2014</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1977–1980, Volume IX, Arab-Israeli Dispute, August
                    1978–December 1980. As part of the <em>Foreign Relations</em> subseries devoted
                    to the foreign policy of the administration of President Jimmy Carter, this
                    volume is the second of two volumes that document U.S. efforts to achieve a
                    negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israeli dispute. This volume begins with the
                    August 1978 acceptance by Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime
                    Minister Menachem Begin of President Carter’s invitation to attend a tripartite
                    summit meeting at Camp David. It traces the course of the September 1978 Camp
                    David Summit and the series of negotiations which followed, talks which
                    culminated in the conclusion of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty on March 26,
                    1979. </p>
         <p>During this period, the Arab-Israeli dispute was top on the list of U.S. foreign
                    policy priorities, reflected in President Carter’s direct involvement in the
                    peace process. With the U.S. failure to broaden Arab support for its diplomatic
                    efforts and the pressures caused by a growing number of crises elsewhere, the
                    administration’s engagement with the Arab-Israeli dispute entered a less
                    intensive phase after the spring of 1979. The volume concludes by documenting
                    the administration’s ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build upon the
                    Egyptian-Israeli Treaty and address the situation in the West Bank and Gaza
                    Strip. During the last eighteen months of the administration, U.S. diplomacy
                    toward this issue focused on keeping the faltering autonomy negotiations on
                    track, securing the continued goodwill and stability of Egypt, mediating Sadat’s
                    public rivalries with other Arab countries, dealing with the upheaval in
                    Lebanon, and addressing the series of resolutions related to the Arab-Israeli
                    dispute brought before the United Nations.</p>
