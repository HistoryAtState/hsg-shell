            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Foreign Service Institute<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>February 12, 2021</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1969–1976, Volume E–15, Part 2, Documents on Western Europe,
                    1973–1976, Second, Revised Edition.</p>
         <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <em>Foreign Relations</em>
                    series that documents the most important foreign policy issues of the Richard M.
                    Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations. The focus of this volume is on the
                    relationship between the United States and Western Europe from 1973 until 1976.
                    It begins by examining the relationship from a regional perspective, focusing on
                    the Year of Europe initiative, U.S. relations with its North Atlantic Treaty
                    Organization allies and the European Communities, and issues such as the rise of
                    Eurocommunism. The volume then explores U.S. bilateral relations with nine
                    countries: Canada, Portugal, Iceland and Norway (paired in a single Nordic
                    countries chapter), Spain, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany,
                    France, and Italy.</p>
         <p>This second, revised edition of <em>Foreign Relations</em>, 1969–1976, volume
                    E–15, Part 2, Documents on Western Europe, 1973–1976, incorporates a chapter on
                    Italy that was not included in the first edition of the volume, which was
                    published in May 2014. The newly added chapter focuses on U.S. concerns about
                    Italian political and economic stability. It features memoranda of conversation
                    documenting meetings between Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and
                    Italian political leaders and assessments of Italian political and economic
                    developments prepared by U.S. officials in Washington and Rome.</p>
         <p>This volume was compiled and edited by Kathleen B. Rasmussen. The volume and this
