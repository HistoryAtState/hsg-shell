         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Bureau of Public Affairs<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>June 7, 2017</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Department of State released today <em>Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</em>, 1977–1980, Volume XV, Central America. This volume is part of a
                        <em>Foreign Relations</em> subseries that documents the most important
                    foreign policy issues of the Jimmy Carter administration.</p>
         <p>The Carter administration’s policy toward Central America stressed human rights
                    and non-interventionism with an aim to expand democracy in the region. Carter’s
                    diplomats worked with Guatemala and Belize to secure a basis for Belize’s future
                    independence from the United Kingdom. In Nicaragua, the Carter administration
                    sought to advance political moderation as the Sandinista National Liberation
                    Front rose against President Anastasio Somoza. After July 1979, Carter offered
                    aid and counsel to the Government of National Reconstruction. Bilateral
                    relations with Costa Rica were dominated by the events in Nicaragua due to Costa
                    Rica’s territorial proximity, and then by the political situation in El
                    Salvador. In Honduras, the United States advised the military Junta government
                    to hold elections and broaden the representation within the government. In El
                    Salvador, a military government faced growing popular opposition from the
                    political left and right. Carter opted to offer military and economic aid in
                    exchange for improvements in human rights practices and progress toward open
                    elections. </p>
