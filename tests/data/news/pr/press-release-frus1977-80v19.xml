         <h2>Press Release</h2>
         <p>
            <strong>Office of the Historian<br/>Foreign Service Institute<br/>United States
                        Department of State<br/>August 8, 2019</strong>
         </p>
         <p>This volume is part of a <em>Foreign Relations</em> subseries that documents the
                    most important foreign policy issues of the Jimmy Carter administration.</p>
         <p>This volume documents the Carter administration’s approach to the South Asia
                    region in response to the shifting political landscape at the end of the 1970s.
                    During the first three years of Carter’s presidency, U.S. relations with South
                    Asia were shaped by three contextual factors: tensions over nuclear
                    proliferation, the rivalry between India and Pakistan, and the Carter
                    administration’s preference for developing closer ties with
                    democratically-elected governments. Under this preference, U.S. relations with
                    India improved while relations with Pakistan withered. The Soviet invasion of
                    Afghanistan in late December 1979 led Carter to seek closer relations with
                    Pakistan in order to thwart what his administration feared to be a new era of
                    Soviet expansion. Carter’s efforts to enlist support against the Soviet Union
                    regarding Afghanistan eclipsed the administration’s fear of nuclear
                    proliferation, and U.S. sponsorship of India-Pakistan rapprochement suffered
                    from the U.S. attempt to send Pakistan large scale military aid and Prime
                    Minister Indira Gandhi’s refusal to condemn the Soviet invasion</p>
         <p>The volume also includes documentation on the Carter administration’s policy
                    towards Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. While issues such as the attempted
                    coup d’état in Bangladesh in 1977 and Bangladesh’s membership in the United
                    Nations Security Council during the Iranian hostage crisis brought Bangladesh in
                    conflict with the Carter administration, relations toward these countries were
                    largely subject to policy objectives relating to India and Pakistan. The
                    promotion of democratic governance and human rights, along with food aid,
                    represented the significant policy initiatives towards these countries.</p>
