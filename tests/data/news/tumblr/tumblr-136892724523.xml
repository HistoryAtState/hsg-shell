         <p>Stephen W. Bosworth, former Special Representative for North Korea Policy and
                    Ambassador to Tunisia, the Philippines, and South Korea, died on January 4.</p>
         <p>Ambassador Bosworth gave an oral history interview to the <a href="http://history.state.gov" shape="rect" target="_blank">Office of the
                        Historian</a> in 2012, in which he touched on his legacy and time in East
                    Asia. When asked about what he felt were some of his successes as Special
                    Representative, he said: “I think we were able to bring coherence to the policy
                    process—a sort of a relentless pursuit of a dialogue with the North Koreans that
                    might not have been present otherwise.  I think we did very importantly maintain
                    very good communication and coordination with our partners in the Six-Party
                    process, particularly the South Koreans.  And out of all of this, one of the
                    signal accomplishments, I think—not just of the North Korea Special
                    Representative, but of the Administration—has been a great strengthening of what
                    was already a good relationship between the U.S. and South Korea.”</p>
         <p>Bosworth spoke of his sole official visit to North Korea: “As special
                    representative, I only went there once.  I had been there a couple of times in
                    the preceding years.  I was there when I was doing KEDO (Korean Peninsula Energy
                    Development Organization) twice.  It’s a very depressing place—very bleak.  It’s
                    profoundly gray in all its aspects.  There’s very little green.  There’s been
                    substantial erosion of most of the land out in the countryside.  It reminds me
                    of what I used to imagine it would’ve been like living in George Orwell’s 1984.
                     It really is indescribably oppressed.” </p>
         <p>On the question of how much of a direct threat he believed North Korea posed to
                    the United States, Bosworth was very pointed: “As a direct threat, almost none.
                     But as an indirect threat, through the possibility of instability in this vital
                    region through pressure on our important economic and security ally, South
                    Korea, I think there is a threat.  Now at some point, one could argue that if
                    they continue to develop their long-range missiles and they make progress on
                    weaponizing their North—their nuclear capabilities, then they could become an
                    actual threat.  That’s not something that keeps me up at night.” </p>
         <p>The tapes and transcript of Ambassador Bosworth’s oral history interview will be
                    retired at the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/" shape="rect" target="_blank">National Archives and Records Administration</a>.</p>
