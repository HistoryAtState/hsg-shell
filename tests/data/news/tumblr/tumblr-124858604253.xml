                        Priorities?</a>
         </h2>
         <p> As the National Archives sets out on its ambitious <a href="http://www.archives.gov/digitization/"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">goal to digitize all of its holdings</a>, planning just how we’re going to
                    accomplish this is critical to our success.  One of the first steps in that plan
                    is prioritizing what will be digitized. No prioritization would be complete
                    without the feedback and suggestions of the people who discover and use our
                    records every day.  </p>
         <p>What would you like to see the National Archives digitize over the next few
                    years?  Is there a particular theme, topic, or event on which you would like to
                    see our digitization efforts focused? </p>
         <p>
            <b>Now is your chance to tell us!</b> From now until August 14th, engage in the
                    discussion about digitization priorities in our online town hall on <a href="https://crowdhall.com/h/443/" shape="rect" target="_blank">Crowd
                        Hall</a>. <b>

                            favorites. </a> </b>
         </p>
