         <p>It has been 54 years since the U.S. Embassy in Havana closed its doors.  Upon
                    ending diplomatic relations with our neighboring island nation, President
                    Eisenhower announced, “It is my hope and my conviction that it is in the not too
                    distant future that it will be possible for the historic friendship between us
                    once again to find its reflection in normal relations of every sort.” Although
                    it has taken more than half a century, President Obama recently announced that

                        relations with Cuba</a>.</p>
         <p>Coincidentally, the National Archives Still Photos Division recently acquired a
                    large collection of photos from the State Department’s <a href="http://overseasbuildings.state.gov/"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">Bureau of Overseas Building Operations</a>.  The collection includes photos
                    of embassies, consulates, and diplomatic residencies from all over the world.
                     Included in this collection are a number of photos from the original U.S.
                    embassy in Cuba.  These photos were processed earlier this month and can be
                    viewed at: <a href="http://unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2015/07/02/re-establishing-diplomatic-relations-with-cuba-historic-photos/"
