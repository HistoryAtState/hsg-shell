         <p>The Louisiana Purchase Exposition, held in St. Louis, Missouri, opened to the
                    public on April 30, 1904. One of the largest international world fairs of the
                    pre-World War One era, the event celebrated the <a href="/milestones/1801-1829/louisiana-purchase"

         <p>On May 19, Secretary of State <a href="/departmenthistory/people/hay-john-milton"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">John Hay</a> gave a speech to the press
                    gathered at the exposition. In celebrating “this great festival of peace and of
                    progress,” the St. Louis native (and former newspaperman) fondly recalled,</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>“The years of my boyhood were passed on the banks of the Mississippi, and the
                        great river was the scene of my early dreams. The boys of my day led an
                        amphibious life in and near its waters in the summer time, and in the winter
                        its dazzling ice bridge of incomparable beauty and purity, was our favorite
                        playground; while our imaginations were busy with the glamour and charm of
                        the distant cities of the South, with their alluring French names and their
                        legends of stirring adventure and pictures of perpetual summer.” [1]<br clear="none"/>
            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Forty countries accepted invitations by the U.S. Government to attend,
                    participate, or be represented in the St. Louis Exposition. Among the foreign
                    exhibits were mosaics from Austria, a “collection of Royal presents” and ostrich
                    feathers from Great Britain, fruits and fish from Canada, “liquors and sirups”
                    from Haiti, cocoa from Peru, and game from New Zealand. Brazil’s display
                    included elements highlighting its “coffee culture” while Ceylon shared its “tea
                    culture” and spices.[2]</p>
