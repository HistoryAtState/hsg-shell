         <p>On May 5, 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower appointed former President Herbert
                    Hoover as his personal representative at that year’s Brussels Universal and
                    International Exhibition. Hoover was well-known to the Belgian people as the
                    head of the Commission for the Relief of Belgium during the First World War.
                    Unlike previous trips he made to the country, he joked in 1958, “this was a
                    happier occasion.”[1] </p>

                    to Belgium (1949-52), arrived in Brussels on July 3. The next day, Hoover spoke
                        “<a href="http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/ebooks/pdf/FULL/B3V8_Full.pdf"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">On American Ideals,</a>” then marked “Hoover
                    Day” on July 5 by speaking “<a href="http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/ebooks/pdf/FULL/B3V8_Full.pdf"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">On the Commission for the Relief of
                    Belgium</a>.” In praising the unprecedented organization that pioneered famine
                    relief efforts in the twentieth century, Hoover said, </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>“This is an occasion and a setting which reaches into the depths of our
                        memories and our emotions. Here in this very room at this very table we
                        worked together for long years in the First World War. Here we managed the
                        supply of food for 10,000,000 people. We cared for the ill, the aged and the
                        destitute. And beyond that our organizations sustained the morale, the unity
                        and the spiritual strength of a people during those four dreadful years. My
                        visit today to Belgium is a happier one for me than for any of your
                        visitors.”[2] </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>The former president culled his memories of those dark wartime years. In one
                    incident, he recalled, a woman in charge of a soup kitchen told him, “the emblem
                    of Belgium is now a child carrying a soup bucket.” The woman noted with pride
                    that Belgians made the best soup on Earth. “And that is still true today,” he
                    told the audience, “but you do not need a bucket to get it.”[3]</p>
         <p>Hoover noted the lasting dividends from that experience. “The Belgian Relief
                    Organization was unprecedented in history,” he said. “It pioneered the war Food
                    Administrations in the modern world. It pioneered the methods of relief of great
                    famines.”[4] </p>
         <p>By 1958, the emphasis on food was no longer solely about survival—instead, it was
                    increasingly celebrated as a cultural endeavor. At the Brussels Exposition, the
                    Brass Rail Restaurant introduced fairgoers to regional American cuisines. One
                    popular highlight was a drugstore soda fountain that served ice creams and
                        sodas. <br clear="none"/>
