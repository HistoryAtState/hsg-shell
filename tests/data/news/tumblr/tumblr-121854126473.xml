               <b>The Battle of Waterloo, as Reported by John Quincy Adams:</b>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>June 18, 2015.  The bicentennial of the battle of Waterloo, one of the
                            most important events in early nineteenth century European history.  At
                            that battle, an Anglo-Allied army commanded by the Duke of Wellington
                            combined with a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard Blucher and
                            defeated the French army commanded by Napoleon.  The battle put an end
                            to the so-called “Hundred Days” marking the period between Napoleon’s
                            return from exile on Elba to the restoration of King Louis XVIII on the
                            throne of France.  It also marked the end of twenty years of European
                            conflict in which the United States was both directly and indirectly
                            involved.</p>

                            reports about that event.  One of the documents they located in the
                            series, Despatches from Diplomatic Officers, 1789-1906 (<a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/603720"
                     shape="rect"
                     target="_blank">NAID 603720</a>) is the July 25, 1815, despatch by
                            U.S. Minister to Great Britain John Quincy Adams (this document can be
                            found on roll 15 of National Archives Microfilm Publication M30).  Adams
                            had only recently presented his credentials as the new U.S. diplomatic
                            representative in Great Britain when the United States and Great Britain
                            renewed diplomatic relations after the War of 1812.</p>
               <p>Among other things, the report, in Adams’s distinctive handwriting,
                            includes brief mentions of the defeat and the battle, notice of
                            Napoleon’s surrender, a comment on the powers performed by Louis XVIII,
                            and reaction of the French people to the restoration:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>”<i>The external combination against Napoleon has again overpowered
                                    him, probably as before with the assistance of internal
                                    treachery</i>.”</li>
                  <li>“<i>After having been defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, he
                                    abdicated again the Imperial dignity, and finding it impossible
                                    to escape, surrendered himself by going on board the British
                                    Ship of War Bellerophon, Captain Maitland.</i>”</li>
                  <li>
                     <i>”Louis 18<sup>th</sup> has again been restored, or rather
                                    permitted by the Allies to issue Proclamations and Ordinances as
                                    king of France – In other respects the allies treat France as a
                                    conquered country – levying contributions; taking possession of
                                    public property; and appointing Governors in the Provinces
                                    overrun by their arms.</i>”</li>
                  <li>”<i>No act of any sort, expressive of the consent of the French
                                    People to be ruled by the Bourbon family has appeared. On the
                                    contrary manifestations of the strongest repugnancy against them
                                    are daily occurring under the half a million of foreign bayonets
                                    by which they have been restored.</i>”</li>
