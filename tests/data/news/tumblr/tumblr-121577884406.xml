         <p>The Haiti Exposition of 1949, “Peace and Progress,” celebrated the bicentennial
                    of Port-au-Prince’s founding and was the first time that an
                    officially-designated world’s fair was held in the Caribbean. The first section
                    of the exposition opened on December 8, 1949, during which President of Haiti
                    Dumarsais Estimé dedicated the exposition’s main thoroughfare as “Boulevard
                    Harry S. Truman.” </p>

         <p>Although the U.S. President was unable to attend, he sent a message, which was
                    delivered by U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William de Courcy at 3:30p.m, </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>“I felicitate Your Excellency in the name of the people of the United States,
                        and through you the Haitian people, upon the inauguration of this Exposition
                        which commemorates the two hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city
                        of Port-au-Prince. On an occasion so auspicious, Haiti can well look back
                        with pride upon two centuries of history during which she won and has
                        retained her independence as the second oldest republic of this
                        hemisphere.”[1] </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p> The exposition’s second portion, which featured international showcases, was
                    inaugurated on February 12, 1950, the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln. The
                    date was selected by the Haitians, “as a tribute to the man who freed the slaves
                    in the vast country to the north.”[2]</p>
