         <p>Despite the gathering clouds of war around the globe in 1938, Secretary of State
                    Cordell Hull commended the planned 1939 New York Exposition as a tool to advance
                    peace. By the fall of 1938, 62 nations and the League of Nations indicated that
                    they would participate or be officially represented in the fair—despite the
                    withdrawal of the German Third Reich earlier that year (citing financial
                    constraints).[1] </p>

         </p>
         <p> The “World of Tomorrow” opened to the public on May 1, 1939, and celebrated, in
                    part, the sesquicentennial of the inauguration of George Washington as the first
                    President of the United States. On May 20, the first regularly scheduled air
                    route between the United States and Europe was inaugurated by a Pan American
                    Airways “flying boat,” the <i>Yankee Clipper</i>.[2] The airliner departed from
                    Port Washington, Long Island, on the twelve-year anniversary of the first
                    nonstop transatlantic flight between New York and Paris undertaken by Charles
                    Lindbergh. Before heading east over the Atlantic Ocean, the Yankee Clipper
                    passed over the Aviation Building at the World’s Fair grounds. </p>
         <p> Rather than serving as a harbinger of peace, the fair’s fall season was marred
                    by the spread of war. Secretary Hull, speaking during the celebration of Pan
                    American Day at the New York Exposition on September 22, nevertheless called on
                    those states not yet embroiled in conflict to continue pressing for peaceful
                    international relations: </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>“Less than a quarter of a century ago, 12 of our American republics were
                        involved in a world war. When that ordeal ended, all of us were determined
                        to devote our best efforts toward the establishment of a world order in
                        which recourse to war as an instrument of accomplishing national aims would
                        be unthinkable….Now that a major war in Europe is a grim reality, there is
                        greater necessity than ever before for all nations, still in a position to
                        do so, to increase their exertions for the preservation of those fundamental
                        principles of civilized international relations, through the application of
                        which alone, we of the Americas are firmly convinced, the progress of the
                        human race can be maintained. There is no other basis of enduring peace, of
                        cultural and material advancement for nations and for individuals, of social
                        and political institutions founded upon human freedom and the dignity of the
                        human soul.”[3] </p>
