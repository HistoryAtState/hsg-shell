      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
         <p>Today, the Office of the Historian is proud to announce our second quarterly
                    “mass launch” of digital <i>Foreign Relations of the United States</i>
                    publications, as we work toward the complete publication of our back catalog,
                    extending back to 1861. This salvo includes sixteen volumes documenting the
                    tumultuous early post-WWII years, beginning with the conferences at Malta and
                    Yalta in 1945, and extending through 1951, as the contours of the Cold War were
                    being drawn. </p>
         <p>The <a href="/historicaldocuments/frus1945Malta"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">Yalta <i>Foreign Relations</i> volume</a>,
                    produced in response to a Congressional request for accelerated coverage of
                    Franklin Roosevelt’s wartime diplomacy, represented a watershed for the series
                    when it <a href="/historicaldocuments/frus-history/chapter-7"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">was first published</a> in 1955. In producing
                    the volume, Department of State historians pursued expanded access to
                    significant records held by other government agencies. Although the <i>Foreign
                        Relations</i> series remained focused on Department of State records for
                    another generation, the Yalta volume began a long process of broadening coverage
                    to incorporate essential documents held by other parts of the U.S.
                    Government. </p>

         <p>The release of these publications represents a long-term partnership between the
                        <a href="http://uwdcc.library.wisc.edu/" shape="rect" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin Madison Digital Collections Center</a> and the
                    Office of the Historian in a program to digitize the entire <i>Foreign
                        Relations</i> series, and post these earlier volumes for public access at <a href="/historicaldocuments/" shape="rect" target="_blank">history.state.gov</a>. To date, the digitization initiative
                    has resulted in the publication of about 270 volumes—over half of the entire
                    back catalog—of the <i>Foreign Relations</i> series. In general, we are
                    publishing the volumes in reverse chronological order, with adjustments based on
                    high-interest events and volumes—for example, we prioritized the release of the
                        <a href="/historicaldocuments/frus1865p4" shape="rect" target="_blank">Lincoln condolence volume</a> to commemorate
                    his death on April 14, and volumes documenting U.S. diplomacy in the <a href="/historicaldocuments/frus1914Supp"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">first days of World War I</a> to coincide with
                    the centennial of that war’s beginning. </p>
         <p>Future publications will move further into the back catalog, and we look forward
                    to announcing their release in future quarters. The full list of volumes
                    released today is below, with links to the online and ebook versions of these
                    volumes. Researchers may also be interested in accessing the raw data for each
                    volume; this can be found on <a href="https://github.com/HistoryAtState/frus"
