            <p>
               <i>What should I have done? More than 30,000 people, in fact the best and
                            most qualified people from the [German Democratic Republic], left the
                            country in July. You can easily calculate when the East German economy
                            would have collapsed if we hadn’t done something soon against the mass
                            flight. There were, though, only two kinds of countermeasures: cutting
                            off air traffic or the Wall. The former would have brought us to a
                            serious conflict with the United States which possibly could have led to
                            war. I could not and did not want to risk that. So the Wall was the only
                            remaining option.</i>

            <p>—Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>It was an act of desperation, a “hateful thing,” in Khrushchev’s words, but the
                    East German leadership had been pleading with their Soviet allies for months to
                    take action against the refugee flow, and finally the situation had become
                    intolerable. Berlin had been a breeding ground for crises since the earliest
                    days of the Cold War; this latest round had begun with the Vienna Summit with
                    Khrushchev and President John F. Kennedy in early June 1961. There Khrushchev
                    demanded that Berlin be transformed into a demilitarized free city, a move that
                    he considered recognition of the <i>de facto</i> status of Germany in the
                    aftermath of WWII. Kennedy rejected this demand, convinced that a U.S.
                    withdrawal from Berlin would cause devastating harm to the credibility of the
                    United States. </p>
         <p>The failure of the summit heightened fears of the East German populace that they
                    might lose the option to cross the border, and so the flow of refugees
                    increased—17,791 in May, 19,198 in June, then an acceleration to over 1000 per
                    day in July and early August. The flow of skilled workers across the border
                    threatened to destroy the East German economy. Finally on July 6, Khrushchev
                    gave in to the long-standing East German plea that the Soviets seal the border
                    to West Berlin. Khrushchev was concerned not just with the U.S. response, but
                    with the East Germans’ willingness to confine the action to East German
                    territory. “Not a millimeter farther,” he emphasized to East German leader
                    Walter Ulbricht. </p>
         <p>The decision triggered a remarkable preparatory stage. Closure would require a
                    massive assembly of materiel, meticulous planning, and careful timing, all under
                    conditions of absolute secrecy. Beyond the creation of physical barriers to
                    movement, the East Germans executed planning on shutting down the vast range of
                    transportation systems then active across the city. The Soviets and East Germans
                    adjusted their military posture, both in command relations—transferring the
                    control of the East German forces to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany— and
                    in a quiet reinforcement and upgrade of Soviet troops in Germany. All was aimed
                    at having the East Germans control the front lines of the borders, with the
                    Soviets providing massive backup. </p>
         <p>In early August, at a meeting of the leaders of the Warsaw Pact states in Moscow,
                    the Soviets and East Germans informed their allies of the planned action in
                    Berlin. There Khrushchev offered Ulbricht the opportunity to decide when to
                    close the border. From the first days of planning the action, the East Germans
                    had expected to execute the closure on a Sunday, when Western response would be
                    delayed and many Berliners would be out of the city. Now Ulbricht and Khrushchev
                    set the date for the night of August 12–13. “The date for beginning of border
                    control,” Khrushchev later recalled, “was to be August 13, 1961. We kidded among
                    ourselves that in the West the thirteenth is supposed to be an unlucky day. I
                    joked that for us and for the entire socialist camp it would be a very lucky day
                    indeed.” </p>
         <p>Neither of the leaders underestimated the risks they were taking with this
                    dramatic action. Ulbricht feared that the West would respond with an economic
                    blockade; he and Khrushchev pressed the other Warsaw Pact allies to provide aid
                    to the East Germans. In the best traditions of alliance relations, the allies
                    responded unenthusiastically to the request for aid, all emphasizing their own
                    economic problems. They were aware as well of the threat of military action, a
                    threat that Khrushchev considered limited but could not entirely discount. </p>
         <p>Ulbricht returned to Berlin, and on August 7 reported on the Warsaw Pact
                    conference to the Politburo. There he announced the timing for the border
                    control measure as the final preparations began. The Soviets and East Germans
                    conducted a last joint planning meeting the day before the closing, and the
                    Soviet representative, Ambassador Mikhail Pervukhin, took this last opportunity
                    to emphasize the importance of not taking this action too far: “If something
                    goes wrong,” he commented to Ulbricht, “we’ll both lose our heads.” Ulbricht
                    signed the orders to close the border at 4 p.m. on August 12, and the operation
                    began at midnight.  As Hope Harrison wrote, “the East Germans started by
                    securing the border with barbed wire, but then added concrete blocks, guard
                    towers, mine strips, dogs, and a shoot-to-kill ban. Free movement on foot, by
                    car, truck, tram, and boat from East to West Berlin was terminated.” Four days
                    later concrete blocks began to appear, eventually growing out into the massive
                    wall that persisted for the decades ahead.</p>
         <p>The extensive planning and preparation by the Soviets and East Germans were
                    remarkably effective in preserving operational security. The Western allies and
                    the United States were taken entirely by surprise. The reaction was further
                    complicated by the need to operate in concert with the allies in different
                    forums, with all the players unwilling to risk war or serious economic conflict.
                    A meeting among the Four Power Ambassadorial Steering Group the day following
                    the closure explored the options available in response—diplomatic protests,
                    limitations on travel, limitations on cultural exchanges, and so on. All agreed
                    that “propaganda exploitation” would be the most important response, and the
                    British provided a list of themes that were accepted by the other powers. </p>
         <p>Mayor Willy Brandt wrote President Kennedy a personal <a href="http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v14/d117"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">letter</a> two days after the wall went up, and
                    Kennedy <a href="http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v14/d120"
               shape="rect"
               target="_blank">responded</a> on August 18. Kennedy conceded
                    that there were “no steps available to us which can force a significant material
                    change in this present situation. Since it represents a resounding confession of
                    failure and of political weakness, this brutal border closing evidently
                    represents a basic Soviet decision which only war could reverse. Neither you nor
                    we, nor any of our Allies, have ever supposed that we should go to war on this
                    point.”  Kennedy chose to respond through a reinforcement of the American
                    garrison in Berlin, and through an acceleration of the military buildup already
                    in progress. </p>
         <p>In the end, the “propaganda exploitation” was in fact the most important
                    response, and it maintained its power through the remaining decades of the Cold
                    War. As the infrastructure of the Wall spread, and the casualties mounted, and
                    as the images of East Germans shot while attempting to escape to the West
                    multiplied, the Wall became an iconic symbol of the vast differences between the
                    Soviet bloc and the West. Presidents from Kennedy to Reagan used the Wall as a
                    backdrop for some of the most memorable remarks in modern American diplomatic
                    history. Finally it was the fall of the Wall on November 9, 1989, that marked
                    the end of the Cold War, as the unceasing impulse of the East German people to
                    find freedom finally overcame the willingness of their leaders to impose control
                    by force.</p>
